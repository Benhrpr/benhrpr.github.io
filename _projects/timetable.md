##### This website was created for an assessment for the class 'Digital User Interface/Experience'.

This prototype website was created so that students could view things like their full names, student codes, classes, lesson plans, classrooms, teachers, form groups and ages.

This website prototype was built using Python and replit.

In order to complete achieve a high grade for this assignment I had to also create a prototype in Adobe XD (an app used to design user experiences).

For this school assessment I recieved the highest grade possible (Outstanding).
