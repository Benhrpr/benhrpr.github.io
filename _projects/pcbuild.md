During the first two week holiday of 2023 I built a personal computer for myself. This computer was created for school work, gaming and coding.

This PC was built inside the 'Fractal Pop Mini Air' which is a mATX (smaller than full size) case.

The specs of this PC were:


CPU: Intel i5-13400f

RAM: Aorus RGB Memory (16gb 3733mhz DDR4) 

Motherboard: B660M Aorus Pro DDR4

SSD: 960 evo 500gb/500gb kingston

GPU: Asrock A750

Case: Fractal Pop Mini Air
